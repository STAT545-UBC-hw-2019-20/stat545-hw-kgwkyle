I am a first year student pursuing my MSc in Geography under Dr. Marwan Hassan with a focus in fluvial geomorphology. Although my undergraduate degree is also from the University of British Columbia, I am initially from New York State. When I am not in school, I enjoy hiking, playing softball, table tennis, and board games.
